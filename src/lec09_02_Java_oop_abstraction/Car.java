// Interface names starts with UpperCase 
// They follow Camel case or Snake case pattern.
// CamelCase or Snake_case feature considered from second word, not from first word
// CamelCase example for an Interface --> CarToyota
// Snake_case example for an Interface --> Car_toyota

// Interview Question
// What is Interface?
// Interface is a Blueprint of the Class.
// It is a collection of methods that are defined (declared) in nature 

// An Interface
// An Interface can't inherit a regular class or an abstract class by extends keyword
// An Interface can inherit more than one Interface (separated by comma) by extends keyword
// A super(parent) interface must be an interface [Here Taxi is the parent or super interface, and Car is child interface]

// implements keyword can't be used inside Interface for inheritance, Regular class or Abstract class

public interface Car extends Taxi, Truck{
	// Global variable
	// Inside Interface, variable can not be declared, see line 17
	// public int year;
	
	// Interview question: Can we declare variables inside Interface? 
	// No, we must have to initialize
	// Interview question: what is the feature of variable that can be used inside Interface?
	// the variables inside Interface are static and final in nature.
	public static final int YEAR = 1880;
	// final means you can't change the value of this variable
	// static is a local member of this Interface, other Interface/class can't call it
	
	// Interview question: Does Interfaces have constructors?
	// Ans: No, Interfaces cannot have constructors
	/*
	public Car () {
		
	}
	*/
	
	// Interface doesn't have method body like methods present in classes
	// and here method is declared inside Interface body, 
	// This is not mandatory to put 'abstract keyword' with the 'abstract method' inside Interface
	// called abstract method (when method is declared)
	public abstract void start();
	public String stop();
	public void brake(String name);
	// These methods can be void type or return type or parameterized type
	
	
	// from Java 1.8, JAVA implemented static and default type method in interface 
	// which are implemented in nature [non abstract]
	// important interview question
	// These below 2 method can be return type, can be parameterized type, can be void type, it doesn't matter

	public static void gear() {
		System.out.println("This Gear feature is from Car Interface");
	}
	
	// This "default" is not access modifier
	// Default methods are allowed only in interfaces
	public default void honk() {
		System.out.println("This Honk feature came from Car Interface");
	}
