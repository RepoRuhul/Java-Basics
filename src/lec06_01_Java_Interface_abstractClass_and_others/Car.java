// Interview Question
// What is Interface?
// Interface is a Blueprint of the Class.
// An interface is a collection of methods that are defined (declared) in nature 

public interface Car {
	// Interface doesn't have method body like methods present in classes
	// and here method is declared inside Interface body, 
	// This is not mandatory to put 'abstract keyword' with the 'abstract method' inside Interface
	// called abstract method (when method is declared)
	public abstract void start();
	public String stop();
	public void brake(String name);
	// These methods can be void type or return type or parameterized type

}
